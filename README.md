## How to create:

`I have completed this using React and NextJs. Throughout the project, I achieved the following:`

 1. **Project Setup:**
    - I set up the project using NextJs, and css framework TailwindCss for an optimized development experience and faster application startup.
 2. **React Components:**
    -  I created some reusable React components.Reusable components help in reducing code duplication and make your codebase more maintainable.
 3. **React Context Hook:**
    -  I created some `context hook` for users `login` info,cart storage for `cart functionality` and `customer`, it helps to get state of any components without drilling props.
 4. **NextJs Router and Auth:**
    -  I have use NextJs app Router and authenticated some routes by using NextJs Route.
